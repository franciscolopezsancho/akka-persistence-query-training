##### adding more tags

Now that we are getting events by tag, there's an use case will probably happen more often than not.
You'll need to filter by certain events. This is, instead of all the events of an entity you want
all the events of all the entities as long they are an specific event. When you understand how this
works you'll see you can mix and match all your filtering needs with this two means to tag.

You already have all the info you need. Keep looking at the same very same API you already used in the previous exercise. There's all you need.
